WhatsApp Group Message Monitor with Alarm Notification
This Python script monitors a specific region of your screen for visual changes, such as new messages in a WhatsApp group chat, and plays an alarm sound when a change is detected. 
It's useful for staying updated on important messages without continuously checking the chat manually.
